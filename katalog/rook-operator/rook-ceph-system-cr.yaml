  # Most resources are represented by a string representation of their name, such as "pods", just as it appears in the URL for the relevant API endpoint.
  # However, some Kubernetes APIs involve a "subresource", such as the logs for a pod. [...]
  # To represent this in an RBAC role, use a slash to delimit the resource and subresource.
